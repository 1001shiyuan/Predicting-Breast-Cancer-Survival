# Predicting Breast Cancer Survival Using Machine Learning Models on Clinical and Gene Expression Data

## Project Description

This project aims to predict breast cancer survival times using machine learning models based on clinical and gene expression data. The models trained include **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosted Trees**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines**. The goal is to predict the survival length of breast cancer patients and identify key influencing factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium)** dataset. This dataset contains gene expression and clinical data from breast cancer patients, as well as their survival outcomes.

- **Dataset Source**:
  - [METABRIC dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric)
- **Primary Dataset**:
  - `METABRIC_RNA_Mutation.csv`: Contains gene expression data, clinical data, and survival outcomes.

## Pipeline

1. **Download the Script and Dataset**:
   - Download the Jupyter notebook script (`ee5573_project.ipynb`) and the **METABRIC_RNA_Mutation.csv** dataset from this GitHub repository.
   
2. **Run the Script**:
   - Open the `ee5573_project.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook**.
   - Ensure that the **METABRIC_RNA_Mutation.csv** file is in the same directory as the script.
   - Run the cells in the script sequentially to preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate the results.
